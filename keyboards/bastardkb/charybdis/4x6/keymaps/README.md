# Custom layouts for Charybdis 4x6

## hthomas

4x6 Hungarian layout for Charybdis.
A compact layout which uses the full 4x6 matrix, intended for Hungarian characters.

The base layer uses home-row mods and fits into the 3x5 matrix (besides the accents).
The second layer is for games and provides a classic layout with Ctrl, Shift, Tab and Esc on the outermost columns, without home-row mods.

The layout has separate layers for numbers, numpad, function keys and navigation keys, all available from the thumb cluster.

Use this with a Hungarian layout, otherwise numbers (zero) and symbols will be messed up.

## hthomas_compact

3x5 Hungarian layout for Charybdis.

I use this layout to simulate a Charybdis Nano using the classic 4x6 Charybdis.
All keys outside the 3x5 matrix and the 3-2 thumb cluster are unassigned.

Use this with a Hungarian layout, otherwise numbers (zero) and symbols will be messed up.
