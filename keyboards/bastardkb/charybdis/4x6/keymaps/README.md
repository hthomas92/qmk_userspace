# Custom layouts for Charybdis 4x6

## hthomas

4x6 Hungarian layout for Charybdis.
A compact layout which uses the full 4x6 matrix, intended for Hungarian characters using the Hungarian keymap.

For users using the US layout, swap KC_0 with KC_GRV and rearrange KC_MINS, KC_EQL, KC_LBRC, KC_RBRC and KC_QUOT where needed.

The base layer uses home-row mods and fits into the 3x5 matrix (besides the letters with accents).
The second layer has a classic layout without home row mod but it uses MT and LT to comfortably access Ctrl, Shift, Tab and Esc on the outermost columns, and switch layers with Space and Backspace.
The third layer is for games and provides a classic layout with Ctrl, Shift, Tab and Esc on the outermost columns, without home-row mods and Mod and Layer taps. Symbls and letters with accents are accessed on the Num layer.

The layout has separate layers for numbers, numpad, function keys and navigation keys, all available from the thumb cluster.

## hthomas_compact

3x5 Hungarian layout for Charybdis.

I use this layout to simulate a Charybdis Nano using the classic 4x6 Charybdis.
All keys outside the 3x5 matrix and the 3-2 thumb cluster are unassigned.

Use this with a Hungarian layout, otherwise numbers (zero) and symbols will be messed up.
